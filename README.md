BearTheme
=======

BearTheme is a bare theme for Adobe Brackets (Code Mirror) style development. It contains clean CSS for primary UI elements, basic syntax and actions, so you don't have to fetch it by yourself via debug tools anymore. Every line contains comment which explains (hopefuly) to which element or action it refers and small tips if needs something extra to work (ex. !improtant).

It's working with Jacob Lauritzen's [Themes for Brackets](https://github.com/Jacse/themes-for-brackets).

###Theme development
1. Install [Themes for Brackets](https://github.com/Jacse/themes-for-brackets) via Extension Manager - makes swaping between themes smooth and easy.
2. Download [BearTheme](https://github.com/trimek/BearTheme/archive/master.zip).
3. Rename BearTheme.css to you themes's name and start playing with options.

###Contribute
If you find element which you would like to include in the BearTheme, please submit an issue (preferably with example code if it's syntax related) or a pull request. 

Good luck with your themes, have fun. :)
