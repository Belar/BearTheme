BearTheme
=======

BearTheme is a bare theme for Adobe Brackets (Code Mirror) style development. It contains clean CSS for primary UI elements, basic syntax and actions, so you don't have to fetch it by yourself via debug tools anymore. Every line contains comment which explains (hopefuly) to which element or action it refers and small tips if needs something extra to work (ex. !improtant).

###Theme development
1. Install [Themes for Brackets](https://github.com/Jacse/themes-for-brackets) via Extension Manager - makes swaping between themes smooth and easy.
2. Download [BearTheme](https://github.com/trimek/BearTheme/archive/master.zip).
3. Copy BearTheme.css to user\themesforbrackets\themes (in Brackets Help > Show Extensions Folder). 
4. **Rename** BearTheme.css to your themes's desired name and start playing with options.


###Contribute
If you find element which you would like to include in the BearTheme, please submit an issue (preferably with example code if it's syntax related) or a pull request. Also, if you created a new theme, consider adding it to Themes for Brackets.

Good luck with your themes, have fun. :)
